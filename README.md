ECOMMAS 2024

I delete many old editions and create two folder, add_point and average dataset.  

## add_point

This folder has some old editions that contain the result of adding pionts.

## average_dataset
This is a new folder containing edtions of using average data to train the model.   
And t_STLSQ_average-sr_C6_01.ipynb adds 't' as a dimension using operator STLSQ, has the best result up to now.
