## Abstract

Understanding the complex in-cylinder flow field under high swirl ratio conditions is crucial for optimizing combustion process in Spark-Ignition Direct-Injection (SIDI) engines. The nature of in-cylinder flow fields is highly complex evidenced by strong non-linearity and acyclic variation aroused from piston movement and air-wall interactions. To elucidate these characteristics, Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) have been applied to simulate the in-cylinder flow field and quantify the cyclic variations of engine flows under motoring or firing operations. In order to construct reliable LES models, the simulation results of in-cylinder flow fields with high temporal and spatial resolutions are commonly validated with highspeed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data. Typical comparisons between experimental PIV flow field measurement data and numerical LES simulation results are illustrated in Fig 1.  Specifically, if discrepancies are discovered between the simulation and experimental results, the simulation results could be calibrated through adjusting parameters such as turbulent viscosity, turbulent intensity, or other model-specific parameters. [1] Although well-calibrated simulation sufficiently approaches to the experiments, the discrepancy still exists and could be accumulative. Moreover, it is challenging to tell whether the discrepancy derives from inaccurate modelling or measurement uncertainty.  

A well-established way to bridge the experiment and simulation resorts to hidden physics behind the complex fluid flow field, which could be well-described by governing physical equations. This study employs a data-driven approach, specifically sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), to extract a concise partial differential equation (PDE) representing the Navier-Stokes equation governing this intricate flow. [2] For sparce identification process in this work, numerical approximations are employed to estimate the time derivatives of chosen variables using finite difference methods. The discrete data obtained is then analysed using sparse regression technique LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), which allows for the sparse selection of nonlinear terms that most effectively characterize the system's dynamics. This data-driven methodology could bridge the gap between experimentation and simulation of high swirl ratio in-cylinder flow field through discrepancy examination and coefficient analysis. Firstly, the entire flow field can be reconstructed by applying the fitted governing equation extracted from experiments. By comparing this reconstructed flow field with experimental or simulation results, we could discern whether the disparities arise from simplifications in the simulation model or uncertainties in experimental measurements. Such an understanding is crucial for optimizing simulation models and refining experimental setups. Additionally, the temporal evolution of the PDE coefficients provides valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of airflow at different phases of the engine cycle, shedding light on the intricate interplay of fluid forces during critical stages such as early intake stroke, near bottom-dead center, and late compression stroke. In summary, not only could this data-driven approach provide a reliable way for PDE reconstruction of the experimental data, it could also reveal the physical quantifications of the complex in-cylinder flow characteristics.
